/// A material design text field for vertical Mongolian script.
///
/// A text field lets the user enter text, either with hardware keyboard or with
/// an onscreen keyboard.
///
/// The text field calls the [onChanged] callback whenever the user changes the
/// text in the field. If the user indicates that they are done typing in the
/// field (e.g., by pressing a button on the soft keyboard), the text field
/// calls the [onSubmitted] callback.
///
/// To control the text that is displayed in the text field, use the
/// [controller]. For example, to set the initial value of the text field, use
/// a [controller] that already contains some text. The [controller] can also
/// control the selection and composing region (and to observe changes to the
/// text, selection, and composing region).
///
/// By default, a text field has a [decoration] that draws a divider to the
/// right of the text field. You can use the [decoration] property to control
/// the decoration, for example by adding a label or an icon. If you set the
/// [decoration] property to null, the decoration will be removed entirely,
/// including the extra padding introduced by the decoration to save space for
/// the labels.
///
/// If [decoration] is non-null (which is the default), the text field requires
/// one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.
///
/// To integrate the [MongolTextField] into a [Form] with other [FormField] widgets,
/// consider using [MongolTextFormField].
///
/// Remember to call [TextEditingController.dispose] of the [TextEditingController]
/// when it is no longer needed. This will ensure we discard any resources used
/// by the object.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// This example shows how to create a [MongolTextField] that will obscure input. The
/// [InputDecoration] surrounds the field in a border using [OutlineInputBorder]
/// and adds a label.
///
/// ![](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/text_field.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// MongolTextField(
///   obscureText: true,
///   decoration: InputDecoration(
///     border: OutlineInputBorder(),
///     labelText: 'Password',
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## Reading values
///
/// A common way to read a value from a MongolTextField is to use the [onSubmitted]
/// callback. This callback is applied to the text field's current value when
/// the user finishes editing.
///
/// For most applications the [onSubmitted] callback will be sufficient for
/// reacting to user input.
///
/// The [onEditingComplete] callback also runs when the user finishes editing.
/// It's different from [onSubmitted] because it has a default value which
/// updates the text controller and yields the keyboard focus. Applications that
/// require different behavior can override the default [onEditingComplete]
/// callback.
///
/// Keep in mind you can also always read the current string from a MongolTextField's
/// [TextEditingController] using [TextEditingController.text].
///
/// ## Handling emojis and other complex characters
///
/// In the live Dartpad example above, try typing the emoji 👨‍👩‍👦
/// into the field and submitting. Because the example code measures the length
/// with `value.characters.length`, the emoji is correctly counted as a single
/// character.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [MongolTextFormField], which integrates with the [Form] widget.
///  * [InputDecorator], which shows the labels and other visual elements that
///    surround the actual text editing widget.
///  * [MongolEditableText], which is the raw text editing control at the heart of a
///    [MongolTextField]. The [MongolEditableText] widget is rarely used directly unless
///    you are implementing an entirely different design language, such as
///    Cupertino.
class MongolTextField extends StatefulWidget {
  /// Creates a Material Design text field for vertical Mongolian text.
  ///
  /// If [decoration] is non-null (which is the default), the text field requires
  /// one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.
  ///
  /// To remove the decoration entirely (including the extra padding introduced
  /// by the decoration to save space for the labels), set the [decoration] to
  /// null.
  ///
  /// The [maxLines] property can be set to null to remove the restriction on
  /// the number of lines. By default, it is one, meaning this is a single-line
  /// text field. [maxLines] must not be zero.
  ///
  /// The [maxLength] property is set to null by default, which means the
  /// number of characters allowed in the text field is not restricted. If
  /// [maxLength] is set a character counter will be displayed to the right of the
  /// field showing how many characters have been entered. If the value is
  /// set to a positive integer it will also display the maximum allowed
  /// number of characters to be entered.  If the value is set to
  /// [TextField.noMaxLength] then only the current length is displayed.
  ///
  /// After [maxLength] characters have been input, additional input
  /// is ignored, unless [maxLengthEnforcement] is set to
  /// [MaxLengthEnforcement.none].
  /// The text field enforces the length with a [LengthLimitingTextInputFormatter],
  /// which is evaluated after the supplied [inputFormatters], if any.
  /// The [maxLength] value must be either null or greater than zero.
  ///

  /// character.

  /// which is the letter "o" followed by a composed diaeresis "¨", or it can
  /// be represented as '\u{00F6}', which is the Unicode scalar value "LATIN
  /// SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS". It will be counted as a single character
  /// in both cases.
  ///
  /// Similarly, some emoji are represented by multiple scalar values. The
  /// Unicode "THUMBS UP SIGN + MEDIUM SKIN TONE MODIFIER", "👍🏽"is counted as
  /// a single character, even though it is a combination of two Unicode scalar
  /// values, '\u{1F44D}\u{1F3FD}'.

  /// isn't necessary to be notified of such changes, since they're
  /// initiated by the app itself.
  ///
  /// To be notified of all changes to the MongolTextField's text, cursor,
  /// and selection, one can add a listener to its [controller] with

  /// ## Handling emojis and other complex characters
  ///
  /// It's important to always use
  /// [characters](https://pub.dev/packages/characters) when dealing with user
  /// input text that may contain complex characters. This will ensure that
  /// extended grapheme clusters and surrogate pairs are treated as single

  ///
  /// For example, when finding the length of some user input, use

  /// `string.runes.length`. For the complex character "👨‍👩‍👦", this

  /// autofills triggered by a different [AutofillClient], even if they're in the

  /// null or empty will disable autofill for this text field.
  ///
  /// The minimum platform SDK version that supports Autofill is API level 26
  /// for Android, and iOS 10.0 for iOS.
  ///
  /// ### Setting up iOS autofill:
  ///
  /// To provide the best user experience and ensure your app fully supports
  /// password autofill on iOS, follow these steps:
  ///
  /// * Set up your iOS app's
  ///   [associated domains](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/supporting_associated_domains_in_your_app).
  /// * Some autofill hints only work with specific [keyboardType]s. For example,
  ///   [AutofillHints.name] requires [TextInputType.name] and [AutofillHints.email]
  ///   works only with [TextInputType.emailAddress]. Make sure the input field has a
  ///   compatible [keyboardType]. Empirically, [TextInputType.name] works well
  ///   with many autofill hints that are predefined on iOS.
  ///
  /// ### Troubleshooting Autofill
  ///
  /// Autofill service providers rely heavily on [autofillHints]. Make sure the
  /// entries in [autofillHints] are supported by the autofill service currently
  /// in use (the name of the service can typically be found in your mobile
  /// device's system settings).
  ///
  /// #### Autofill UI refuses to show up when I tap on the text field
  ///
  /// Check the device's system settings and make sure autofill is turned on,
  /// and there're available credentials stored in the autofill service.
  ///
  /// * iOS password autofill: Go to Settings -> Password, turn on "Autofill
  ///   Passwords", and add new passwords for testing by pressing the top right
  ///   "+" button. Use an arbitrary "website" if you don't have associated
  ///   domains set up for your app. As long as there's at least one password
  ///   stored, you should be able to see a key-shaped icon in the quick type
  ///   bar on the software keyboard, when a password related field is focused.
  ///
  /// * iOS contact information autofill: iOS seems to pull contact info from
  ///   the Apple ID currently associated with the device. Go to Settings ->
  ///   Apple ID (usually the first entry, or "Sign in to your iPhone" if you
  ///   haven't set up one on the device), and fill out the relevant fields. If
  ///   you wish to test more contact info types, try adding them in Contacts ->
  ///   My Card.
  ///
  /// * Android autofill: Go to Settings -> System -> Languages & input ->
  ///   Autofill service. Enable the autofill service of your choice, and make
  ///   sure there're available credentials associated with your app.
  ///
  /// #### I called `TextInput.finishAutofillContext` but the autofill save
  /// prompt isn't showing
  ///
  /// * iOS: iOS may not show a prompt or any other visual indication when it
  ///   saves user password. Go to Settings -> Password and check if your new
  ///   password is saved. Neither saving password nor auto-generating strong
  ///   password works without properly setting up associated domains in your
  ///   app. To set up associated domains, follow the instructions in
  ///   <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/supporting_associated_domains_in_your_app>.
  ///
  /// For the best results, hint strings need to be understood by the platform's
  /// autofill service. The common values of hint strings can be found in
  /// [AutofillHints], as well as their availability on different platforms.
  ///
  /// If an autofillable input field needs to use a custom hint that translates to
  /// different strings on different platforms, the easiest way to achieve that
  /// is to return different hint strings based on the value of
  /// [defaultTargetPlatform].
  ///
  /// Each hint in the list, if not ignored, will be translated to the platform's
  /// autofill hint type understood by its autofill services:
  ///
  /// * On iOS, only the first hint in the list is accounted for. The hint will
  ///   be translated to a
  ///   [UITextContentType](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitextcontenttype).
  ///
  /// * On Android, all hints in the list are translated to Android hint strings.
  ///
  /// * On web, only the first hint is accounted for and will be translated to
  ///   an "autocomplete" string.
  ///
  /// Providing an autofill hint that is predefined on the platform does not
  /// automatically grant the input field eligibility for autofill. Ultimately,
  /// it comes down to the autofill service currently in charge to determine
  /// whether an input field is suitable for autofill and what the autofill
  /// candidates are.
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  /// * [AutofillHints], a list of autofill hint strings that is predefined on at
  ///   least one platform.
